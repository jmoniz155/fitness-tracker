`This is a Employee Tracker application that allows a user to add a work out with how long youve worked out, the amount of weight you lifted as well as how many reps you've accomplished. A user is also able to edit and delete a work out.`

## Function

This application allows a user to add, edit and continue a saved workout. Simply answer the prompts and it will generate a saved workout, so a user can track their fitness.

## Credits

I would like to give credit to my Varsity Tutor for helping me understand how to add routes, and link with mongoose.
